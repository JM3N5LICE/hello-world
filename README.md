# Overview

This is a program to demonstrate that I am capable of creating and uploading to a repository.

The code is simply printing and displaying in the terminal the phrase "Hello World!". 

The purpose beyond demonstrating my ability to use the repository is to show that I am becoming familair with other languages. As I learn languages in the future I will put all the beginning hello world assignents in this repository.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used for this project were:
* vscode(IDE)
* The python extension in vscode
* A repository (Git via Github via commandline)
* This markdown language file

I used python because it is the first coding language that I learned at BYU-I and it is also the easiest for me. It is pretty straigtforward and reads like pseudocode.
